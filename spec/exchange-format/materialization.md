# Materialization

This document describes the rules for turning a serialized metadata tree back into local current state.

## Materialize responsibilities

When materializing a remote metadata head, the client must:

1. merge that head in memory into local serialized metadata
2. resolve merge conflicts according to value-type semantics
3. update the local SQLite database with newly visible values and tombstones
4. record when materialization succeeded

Per-type conflict rules are defined in:

- [Strings](./strings.md)
- [Lists](./lists.md)
- [Sets](./sets.md)

## High-level scenarios

### 1. Initial sync

If the local system has no metadata yet:

- walk the tree at the incoming metadata head
- materialize all visible values into SQLite
- record that metadata commit as materialized

No metadata history walk is required beyond the current tree.

### 2. Multiple start points

If local metadata exists and someone else already pushed an independently initialized metadata history:

- serialize local shareable state
- perform a baseless two-way merge with the remote tree
- for overlapping keys, remote wins
- write a new metadata commit with the remote head as parent
- retry if the remote advanced before push completed

This allows eventual convergence while keeping history linear.

### 3. Fast-forward update

If the incoming metadata ref is a fast-forward from the last materialized point:

- diff the old materialized tree against the new tree
- apply only changed key/values to SQLite
- add or update visible values and tombstones

### 4. Both sides mutated data

If local data changed and remote data also changed:

- serialize local current shareable state
- merge the remote tree into it
- resolve conflicts according to per-type semantics
- write a new metadata commit from the merged tree

On push, if it is again not a fast-forward, do this sequence repeatedly against newer remote heads until a fast-forward push succeeds. Only one new commit locally needs to be made.

## No common ancestor merge

If local and remote metadata histories have no common ancestor, materialize uses a two-way merge instead of a three-way merge.

1. union non-conflicting keys from both sides
2. for overlapping keys or value-vs-tombstone conflicts, remote wins
3. retain non-overlapping keys from both sides

## Removal handling

Deletion is explicit.

During materialization:

- whole-key tombstones remove keys locally
- per-entry or per-member tombstones are applied according to the collection type

## Metadata history shape

Unlike source-code history, metadata history does not need rich branch/merge topology.

The preferred shape is linear history created by repeatedly:

- merging in memory
- writing a new commit
- fast-forward pushing

The main goal is convergence on current metadata state, not preserving meaningful branch structure.

## Merging

- update locally, pruned remotely?
