# gmeta spec

The `gmeta` tool is a Rust command line application, using Clap, that allows one to add structured metadata to Git data.

It stores this data in SQLite and provide CRUD operations via the command line to add, modify and delete key/value data for commits, change-ids, branch-ids, file paths or the project as a whole.

## SQLite

The SQLite file that contains this data is found or created at `.git/gmeta.sqlite`.

## Data

There will be two important data aspects to this. The first is the current value of any key. The second is a log of the mutation of the value of this key, so we can see what it was at any time. This log should have timestamps and an email address of the user who mutated it.

Each metadata value will have four parts. The target, the key, the value and the value type.

The target consists of two parts - the target type and the target string. This can be one of:

- 'commit', string is the Git commit SHA
- 'change-id', string is a UUID
- 'branch', string is a branch UUID or name
- 'path', string is a file path in the project
- 'project', no associated string - it's a global value

The key can be any arbitrary string. It can be namespaced with colons, for example 'agent:transcript' or 'agent:model:version'.

The value type can be one of three types (but we can extend this in the future).

- 'string' : single value
- 'list': array of strings

This allows us to have a set of simple operations for each value type (ie, 'append' for a list, 'insert' or 'replace' for a hash key)

The values will be mutated with the command line tool and will both update the log and have the most recent value quickly (O(1)) accessible in the design of the SQLite data system.

The command line tools will be:

`gmeta set [-t list] <target> <key> <value>` - if type is not given, assumes a string
`gmeta get <target> (<key>)` - show key value(s) (if partial key given or no key given, show all key/value pairs)
`gmeta rm <target> <key>` - remove key

Where `<target>` is `type:string`, for example, `commit:<SHA>`.

To set a list of values, `<value>` will be a JSON array and `-t list` must be specified. Otherwise, the value will be a JSON string rather than a list type.

For list values:

`gmeta list:push <target> <key> <value>` - adds to a list
`gmeta list:pop <target> <key> <value>` - adds to a list

If you push to a value that is a string, it will convert it to a list.

## Exchange

This data should be exchangeable over the Git protocol, meaning that we need to be able to serialize the current values into Git trees and commits and push them as references to any Git host.

We also need to be able to fetch these references from a Git host and materialize them locally into our own SQLite database.

We don't need the entire log to be serialized in the exchange format, only the most recent values.

The serialization format should be in Git tree format, so it can be easily diffed and transferred.

The commit pointing to the new serialized data should be stored under `refs/meta/local`, or something other than `meta` if `meta.namespace` Git config setting is set.

If you fetch from a remote with meta references, it should put that reference into `refs/meta/[remote-name]` (so, for example, `refs/meta/origin`).

### Serialize tree format

The base tree path for any target key should be the target type, then the first 2 char of the target value, then the last 3 char of the target value, then the full target value.

Keys under 3 char would not be valid.

### String values

For string values, it should simply write the string as a blob under the key. The key should be split by `:` into new subtrees, so `agent:model` is stored under `[base]/agent/model`.

So for example, if you run `gmeta set commit:13a7d29cde8f8557b54fd6474f547a56822180ae agent:model claude-4.6`, and serialize the data, you would get a Git tree:

```
❯ git ls-tree -r refs/meta/local
100644 blob a76e08d661b081b4e618e7e61066c879056c8f18 commit/13/0ae/13a7d29cde8f8557b54fd6474f547a56822180ae/agent/model
```

If you `git cat-file -p a76e08d661b081b4e618e7e61066c879056c8f18` you would get the string `claude-4.6`.

The commit message of the serialization would have no commit message body, but would simply be used for the tree pointer and author/date information.

### List values

For list values, we do an extra subtree with timestamps:hash as the blob names, so we can generally easily merge them while keeping them sorted.

So, if we run: `gmeta set -t list branch:sc-branch-1-deadbeef agent:chat ["how's it going", "pretty good"]`

Our serialized tree will look like this:

```
❯ git ls-tree -r refs/meta/local
100644 blob b4e618e7e61066c879056c8f18a76e08d661b081 branch/sc/eef/sc-branch-1-deadbeef/agent/chat/1771232450203-23c0f
100644 blob 066c879056c8f1b4e618e7e618a76e08d661b081 branch/sc/eef/sc-branch-1-deadbeef/agent/chat/1771232450204-0d5f2
```

The `23c0f` are the first five chars of the SHA-256 hash of the message being stored, so messages at the same general time will almost certainly not collide from a merge of the same list of different users.

You can also notice that the second message is 1 millisecond from the first. We take the ms epoch timestamp of when the `set` command is run and if we're inserting multiple values, we increment the ms by 1 for each value so they're still in order.

### Commands

The commands to serialize and materialize the data are:

`gmeta serialize` - write a new head to `refs/meta/local`
`gmeta materialize (<remote>)` - read from `refs/meta/remotes/*`, find anything not in local, make local sqlite data consistent. the `(remote)` is optional, otherwise we will look through all the heads under `refs/meta/remotes` and materialize all of them.

### Merging

When we `materialize` a remote meta head, we need to do four things.

1. merge that head into our `refs/meta/local`
2. resolve any merging conflicts
3. update our local sqlite database with all new values
4. record when we last materialized successfully

When we serialize again, we should look in our log for anything that has been modified since the last materialization, and only update the tree with those new values or mutations.

The `list` values should almost always cleanly merge. If there is an overlap of two tree entries with different shas, just drop one (it's almost impossible, since it's a timestamp _and_ partial content hash).

The `string` values can conflict if two users modified the same key. In this case, simply take the one with the later commit timestamp as the new value by default. In the future, we could add different merge strategies.

#### Merging Removals

If you remove a key, during merge it should simply remove it. If one side removed it and the other modified it, choose the modified value.

### Showing Values

There are several ways to show values. The `gmeta get` command can take only a target, a target and a key, or a target and a partial key. It can also take a `--json` argument to return the data in json format.

An example human output would be:

```
❯ gmeta get commit:13a7d29cde8f8557b54fd6474f547a56822180ae
agent:model  claude-4.6
agent:provider  anthropic
```

Or json:

```
❯ gmeta get --json commit:13a7d29cde8f8557b54fd6474f547a56822180ae
{
	'agent': {
		'model': 'claude-4.6',
		'provider': 'anthropic'
	}
}
```

With json, you can also add `--with-authorship` to add the commit timestamp and email address of when each entry was last modified and by whom.

```
❯ gmeta get --json --with-authorship commit:13a7d29cde8f8557b54fd6474f547a56822180ae
{
	'agent': {
		'model': {
			'value': 'claude-4.6',
			'author': 'schacon@gmail.com',
			'timestamp': 1771232450000
		}
		'provider': {
			'value': 'anthropic',
			'author': 'schacon@gmail.com',
			'timestamp': 1771232450000
		}
	}
}
```
